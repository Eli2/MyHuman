- create automatic camera movement to focused part. In example, if the
  user press "nose", the camera zoom on the nose.  Perhaps this could be  
  compined with Hotspot support in animorph

- Add a lot of targets and bs, for somatotypes and standard characters 
  series

- Add verts to mesh, to make clothes and extra details

- Study/apply rendering features by renderman

- Redo from scratch all target icons

- a little transparency bug in some toolbar icons

- Select the best targets, and delete retundant/nosense targets

- BUG: something is wrong with axis and grid angle
  -> grid corrected, but axis too?

- BUG: if closing MakeHuman not with <ESC>, but with window menu I get a segfault and core file on Linux. Need to investigate this!

- rewrite README.txt and explain licence

- the target buttons in face and body are mirrored. See if this is a mhgui or makehuman problem and fix it

- show splash image

- use windres in xmingw 

- replace the "cp" command in Makefile.am with "find --exec cp"

- fix the "make distcheck" problem


GUI

- Use the background image for rotoscopy

- support fullscreen mode

ANIMORPH

- create binary format files [probably abandoned]

- muscle engine

- hair rendering

- Asymmetry system (easy) some typical asymmetrical targets [@Manuel: could you explain this?]

- Symmetry system: read the targets like l_my_target.target and check if
  r_my_target.target is applied. If not it's applied.

- Add a geometry smooth function, like Blender special transformation.
  It'a a sort of mesh relax. [@Manuel: could you explain this?]

- split animorph into several small libraries

- export vertex groups in OBJ file

- use the same convention to get data from objects. Currently sometimes 
  we access "x" direct or x() or getX().
